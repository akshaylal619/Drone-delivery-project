# Hybrid Drone-Enabled Food Delivery System

Cost-benefit analysis and strategic rollout plan for implementing a hybrid food delivery system using drones and delivery executives.

## Project Overview
The goal is to enhance scalability, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize operational costs by introducing drone-enabled deliveries alongside human delivery executives.

- **Time Horizon**: 3 Years
- **Pilot Cities**: Bangalore, Delhi NCR
- **Key Factors**: Revenue, Operational Costs, Customer Satisfaction, Scalability


## Key Insights

- Drones reduce delivery times, increasing customer satisfaction (higher NPS scores).
- Delivery executives' churn rate decreases by offloading peak demand.
- Breakeven expected 2040-2045
- Major investment upfront for drones, compensated by scalability over time.

## Dashboard and Visualizations

Visuals include:
- Yearly Cost vs Revenue trends
- Operational Cost Breakdown (Executives vs Drones)
- Projected Net Profit/Loss over 3 years
- Customer Satisfaction Improvement (NPS growth)

## Rollout Plan

1. **Pilot Launch** â†’ Bangalore, Delhi NCR
2. **Expansion Phase** â†’ High-demand cities with congestion issues
3. **Infrastructure Development** â†’ Drone stations, maintenance hubs
4. **Algorithm Update** â†’ Intelligent assignment between drones and executives

## ðŸ“œ Conclusion

The hybrid delivery model demonstrates strong potential for improving delivery performance and operational efficiency if implemented carefully and gradually.
